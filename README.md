# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **Machine Learning Pipeline** for predicting house prices based on various features. It is designed to cover the **entire lifecycle of a Data Science project**, making it ideal for professionals who have not worked with large datasets before.

**Dataset**: [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

## 🔍 Data Science Lifecycle
The project follows a structured Data Science Lifecycle:
1. **Data Analysis** 📊
2. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️
3. **Model Selection** 🎯
4. **Model Building** 🤖
5. **Model Deployment** 🚀

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Data Analysis
In this phase, we perform an exploratory analysis to understand the dataset better:
- **Missing Values** 🔍
- **Numerical Variables** 📈
- **Distribution of Numerical Variables** 📊
- **Categorical Variables** 🏷️
- **Cardinality of Categorical Variables** 🔢
- **Outliers Detection** 🚨
- **Relationship Between Features and Target Variable (SalePrice)** 💲

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: Feature Engineering
Feature engineering plays a critical role in improving model performance. The following steps are performed:
- **Handling Missing Values**
- **Processing Temporal Variables** (Year Features)
- **Encoding Categorical Variables** (Removing Rare Labels)
- **Standardizing Variables** (Scaling Features to the Same Range)

---

## 🔬 Phase 3: Model Selection
We utilize **Lasso Regression** to select the most relevant features. The Lasso model shrinks coefficients of less important features to zero, thus improving the model's interpretability and performance.

**Key Steps:**
- Implement **Lasso Regression** with `SelectFromModel`.
- Identify and retain only the most important features.

✅ **Selected Features:**
- `Unnamed: 0`
- `YearRemodAdd`
- `ExterQual`
- `BsmtQual`

❌ **Features Removed:** 79 irrelevant features were dropped.

## 📊 Phase 4: Model Building
Using the refined dataset, we build predictive models for house price estimation. Various models such as **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests** can be tested to evaluate their performance.

## 🚀 Phase 5: Model Deployment
Once an optimal model is identified, it can be deployed using Flask, FastAPI, or cloud-based services like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
